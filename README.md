Hi there, I'm Elena. I have completed the Frontend courses. My course-work is made as a multi-page application created with Vue.js framework. I took a template from the telegram channel with free templates.
The website is about heplping businesses with practical ideas and plans.
I changed some features from the template according to the responsiveness and the preferences, so that this website looks completed and appealing to users.
To create this project, I used such technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- Framework Vue.js
I implemented modern features of front-end development as much as I could to represent a user-friendly website.
I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do! Thank you for your attention!
